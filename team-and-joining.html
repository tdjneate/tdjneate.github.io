        <h2>PhD Projects with Me</h2>


        <div class="lead">


            I am always on the lookout for excellent PhD students to work with me in the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/hcc"> Human Centred Computing</a> group at King's. I am keen to work with PhD students interested in projects in the areas of HCI, accessibility, novel interaction techniques and content creation/consumption technologies. Look at my <a href="publications.html"> publications</a> to get an idea of my interests.

            <h3>Funding Options</h3>
            <ul class="dashed">
                  <li> 1 fully funded position for October 2026 entry on my Future Leaders Fellowship (see <a href="flf/flf_annoucement.html"> here</a> for more)</li>

                <li>Fully-funded positions for exceptional candidates through KCL scholarships. These funding allocations are for full fees and a living stipend (London weighted) for any nationality.</li>

                <li> <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/funding/kings-china-scholarship-council-phd-scholarship-programme-k-csc"> King's China Scholarships</a> (for Chinese nationals). These funding allocations are for full fees and a living stipend (London weighted).</li>

                <li> Fully-funded as part of the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study-legacy/funding/kings-centre-for-doctoral-training-in-data-driven-health">King’s Centre for Doctoral Training in Data-Driven Health</a>.</li>

                <li>Alternative funding: if you are keen to do a PhD but are not sure how to fund, or wish to self-fund, I am happy to work towards putting together applications for PhD fellowships for exceptional candidates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Are You the Right Fit?</h3>
            
            I am interested in students who can demonstrate some technical skills (e.g. programming, electronics), HCI skills (e.g. running user studies, interviewing) and research skills (e.g. data analysis, paper writing). I would also like to see some previous work in innovative human-computer interaction work (e.g., undergraduate or postgraduate projects in this area). King's expects students to have First-Class Honours at Undergraduate level or Distinction at Master's level (or its international equivalent). If you do not meet these criteria, there might be alternative ways to demonstrate your competence.

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            As I am sure you appreciate, academics get many emails from prospective PhD students; many of whom send out their proposals to hundreds of academics and have little/no bearing on their research. I normally do not have time to respond to these. If you meet the above criteria and want to do a PhD, <a href="mailto:timothy.neate@kcl.ac.uk">get in touch</a> with:
            <ul class="dashed">
                <li> Your CV</li>
                <li> A paragraph about your proposed research and why you are the person to conduct it</li>
                <li> A paragraph on what you think a PhD will involve and why you want to do one</li>
                <li> A writing sample -- this can be anything from an assignment to a published paper</li>
                <li> A sentence on your favourite animal and why</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Current Projects</h3>
            My currently defined projects can be found <a href="phd_projects.html">here</a>, but I am happy to discuss other projects which align with my general research vision.
