                    <p>Hi, I'm Tim. I am a Senior Lecturer (equivalent to Associate Professor) in the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/informatics">Department of Informatics</a> at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/">King's College London</a>. I am a UKRI Future Leaders Fellow </p>

                    <p>I focus on human-computer interaction and accessibility. My research considers two main areas: developing technologies that are more accessible to diverse populations with varying access needs, and creating technologies that support accessible communication. Specifically, I work in the domains of assistive technology, accessible digital content creation and consumption, and accessible healthcare technologies.
                    </p>

                    <p>To learn more, take a look at my <a href="publications.html">published work</a> or the various bits of <a href="press.html">press coverage</a> my work has attracted.</p>
